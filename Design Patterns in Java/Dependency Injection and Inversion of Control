Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control

- If a class A has has-a relationship with class B object, it needs class B object for it to be instantiated.
- This can be achieved by passing it from constructors, setters etc.
- Spring provides this inherent capability of first creating the class B object and then injecting it to Class A's instance. This is known as dependency injection.
- Mechanism is also known as Inversion of control.
