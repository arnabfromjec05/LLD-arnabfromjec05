Decorator Pattern

A decorator pattern is a behavioural pattern that adds additional functionality to an object dynamically at runtime. A decorator wraps an object with additional behaviour without affecting other objects of the same type. 

The classes in the input output streams in Java use the decorator pattern to read and write files.
