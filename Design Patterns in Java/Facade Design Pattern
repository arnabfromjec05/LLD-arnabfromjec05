Facade Design Pattern

- It's a structural design pattern to hide the complexities of the system.
- Facade layer acts as a layer intermediate between client and the system, and it's responsible for calling the system components/methods/classes etc one by one whenever client calls a request.


Client -> Facade -> 1) CheckStock
					2) PlaceOrder
					3) ShipOrder
