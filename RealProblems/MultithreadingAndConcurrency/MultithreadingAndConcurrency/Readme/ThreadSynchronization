Thread synchronization:
Since threads shares the common address space of the process, often times it's intended that only one thread
accesses the shared memory location. This can be achieved by thread synchronization.
ex:- in Booking movie tickets or train tickets, the seat availability variable is updated once the thread completes
the booking, meanwhile other threads shouldn't be allowed to update the seat availability as it's a critical section
and scenario can lead to race conditions.

1. synchronized(Object obj) - Used to lock a given code block.
2. defining function as synchronized -
public synchronized boolean func() {} -> here it means synchronized(this) over the entire func() block
for static methods: synchronized will boil down to synchronized(<className>.class)

- If a function is defined as synchronized in a class, it's derived class may or mayn't retain the synchronized attribute
of the overridden method.
